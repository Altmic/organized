* [COMPLETED] Convert to CoffeeScript

  * [COMPLETED] If you press ctrl-return you should have a star at the same level on
    a new line.
  * [COMPLETED] If you press return you should get a new line without a star
  * [COMPLETED] Make this behavior configurable so users can turn it off if they
    don't like it.
  * [COMPLETED] If you hit enter on a level created with multiple stars, the new line should also be multi-star
  * [TODO] Figure out why I can't bind shift-enter correctly.

    tab intentations or whitespace indentations.
  * Whichever line has the highest number wins
  * Ignore lines that have both
  * If sample size is too low, use more lines.
* [TODO] Auto-tab to correct level on paste
* [TODO] Command to unify indent as all tabs or all spaces.
