* [COMPLETED] Convert to CoffeeScript
* [COMPLETED] Figure out why I have to toggle to get keybindings to work
  * It's because I was using activationCommand.  If it's absent, atom will
    activate your package by default.
  * [COMPLETED] Request a change to the flight manual to point this out more explicitly
* [COMPLETED] Remove toggle, it's not being used.
* [COMPLETED] Extract the star finding logic -- it's going to be reused somewhat heavily
* Initial commit
  * [COMPLETED] Create github repository for organized project
  * [COMPLETED] Set version number in project.json
* [COMPLETED] Figure out why styles do not work consistently
* Page Organization
  * [COMPLETED] Add support for atx/markdown-style headings (#, ##, ###, etc)
* Outlining
  * [COMPLETED] Implement indent
  * [COMPLETED] Implement unindent
  * [COMPLETED] Figure out how to group undos for indent and unindent
  * [TODO] Expand / Collapse stars written like '**' as opposed to '  *'
  * [COMPLETED] Setting of whether you want different depth levels to be shown
    as multiple stars or as whitespace and stars
  * [COMPLETED] Support numbers as outline levels
  * [COMPLETED] Hitting enter at the beginning of a line shouldn't delete the content of the line
  * [TODO] Highlighting multiple lines and indenting should indent all of the lines
* Visibility cycling
  * [TODO] Add folding to menus to raise visibility
  * [TODO] Start supporting folding for '**' style stars (space-indented ones already work)
* Improve return key Support
  * [COMPLETED] If you press ctrl-return you should have a star at the same level on
    a new line.
  * [COMPLETED] If you press return you should get a new line without a star
  * [COMPLETED] Make this behavior configurable so users can turn it off if they
    don't like it.
  * [COMPLETED] If you hit enter on a level created with multiple stars, the new line should also be multi-star
  * [TODO] Figure out why I can't bind shift-enter correctly.
    * This might be due to peculiarity in chromium css specificity.
* [TODO] Add setting to autowrap at gutter
* [TODO] Different coloring depending on the number of stars in a star block
* [TODO] Properly support soft-tabs settings
* [TODO] Support Atom's tab-length setting
* [TODO] Support Atom's tab type settings (soft and hard)
* [TODO] Support Atom's auto tab type setting
  * Perhaps look at the first 1000 lines of a file -- see if we have more
    tab intentations or whitespace indentations.
  * Whichever line has the highest number wins
  * Ignore lines that have both
  * If sample size is too low, use more lines.
* [TODO] Auto-tab to correct level on paste
* [TODO] Command to transform existing indent as all tabs or all spaces.
* Tests
  * I'm already getting to the point where it is difficult to retest everything and I only have 250 line CoffeeScript
    file.  We need some spec tests.
  * [COMPLETED] Learn how to write spec tests
  * [COMPLETED] Write tests for all existing functionality
* Links
  * [TODO] Highlighting / link following for Urls

* Todos
  * [COMPLETED] Key command to toggle "TODO", "CLOSED", remove todo
  * [TODO] Option to mark closed todo's with current time
  * [TODO] Priorities for TODO items
  * [TODO] Key-command to increase / decrease priority of items
  * [TODO] Support multiple cursors for TODO toggling.
  * [TODO] Command to remove completed todos from current file
  * [TODO] UI for all TODO's in directory
  * [TODO] Configuration to show what directories we'll scan for TODO items
  * [TODO] Setting to auto-hide completed todo items
  * Figure out how to model the storage of TODO items
    * We should probably model parent-child relationship (parent outline node is a todo and it has children
      that also have todo items).
      * This would allow us to show todo items in search results with the children rolled up by default.  If we unrolled
        then all the items below would show up as well.

    * Maybe this should be accordian style with both todos and agenda on a
      single page

    changes in an organized file

  * [TODO] Allow todo lists by tags
  * [TODO] Saved filters for todo lists
  * [TODO] Saved filters for search / exploration
  * [TODO] Recent searches
    * Need to learn a bit more about serialization here - how much can I reasonably
      store via serialization?  It seems like this will cause a problem at some point
      depending on how much control there is.
* Export
  * [TODO] Export as HTML
  * [TODO] Export as PDF
* Safety
  * [TODO] Add ability to encrypt notes
